                        <h2>The House That Amazon Built</h2>
                        <p>
                            Amazon changed the e-book world completely. The Kindle and its store made it effortless for
                            readers
                            to
                            buy and download books in seconds, and that convenience pulled millions into Amazon's
                            system.
                            The
                            catch
                            is that Kindle devices only work with Amazon's own file format, which makes it harder for
                            other
                            companies like Barnes & Noble or Kobo to compete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because Amazon reaches so many readers, most authors and publishers feel like they don't
                            have
                            much
                            choice but to sell through the Kindle platform. Books listed on Kindle are seen by more
                            people
                            than
                            anywhere else.
                            That kind of reach gives Amazon a lot of control over pricing and distribution, which makes
                            it
                            difficult
                            for smaller platforms to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An article <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8889052/">published in 2022</a>
                            argues
                            that the e-book market would benefit from greater openness, such as letting Kindle devices
                            read
                            books bought from other stores. More flexibility would give readers and writers real freedom
                            and
                            allow competition to grow again<sup>2</sup>.

                        <h2>Reader's Choice</h2>
                        <p>
                            Amazon might dominate the market, but it isn't the only option when it comes to e-books and
                            e-readers. Other e-readers still have loyal users and unique features that make them worth a
                            look.
                            Each brand handles books and formats a little differently, and some are more flexible than
                            others.
                            The table below shows how the four major
                            e-readers - Kindle, Nook, Kobo, and Boox - compare in compatibility, and what each of them
                            can
                            actually do.
