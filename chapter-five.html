                        <p>
                            E-books have made reading easier, lighter, and more sustainable. They cut down on paper
                            waste,
                            make
                            books available instantly, and let readers carry entire libraries wherever they go. More
                            importantly, e-books are adaptable. Font size, brightness, and language can all be adjusted,
                            making
                            reading possible for more people than ever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rise of e-books has also transformed publishing. Traditional publishers release around a
                            million
                            new titles each year, but self-publishing platforms like KDP have made it possible for
                            anyone to
                            release a book. More than 1.7 million self-published titles enter the market annually, and
                            that
                            number is likely even higher since many authors self-publish without a trackable
                            ISBN<sup>5</sup>.

                        <h2>Who Holds the Pen?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Traditional publishing still carries credibility and professional support, but it often
                            comes at
                            a
                            cost. Authors usually give up some rights to their work and wait months, sometimes years,
                            for
                            publication.
                            Royalties hover between ten and fifteen percent. Self-publishing, on the other hand, gives
                            writers
                            control. They keep their rights, set their prices, and earn more per sale. The trade-off is
                            the
                            workload. Self-published authors have to cover editing, marketing, and design on their own,
                            and
                            success is never guaranteed.

                        <h2>The Story Continues</h2>
                        <p>
                            The future of books will not be about print versus digital - it will be about access,
                            choice,
                            and
                            quality. Self-publishing makes it easier than ever to share stories, but it also floods the
                            market
                            with uneven quality. Printed books still outsell e-books every year, which suggests that
                            readers
                            are
                            not ready to give them up<sup>6</sup>. Still, e-books continue to grow because they make
                            reading
                            possible for people who might not otherwise have the chance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether it is printed or paperless, what matters most is the story itself. The format may
                            keep
                            changing, but the need to read, write, and connect never will.
