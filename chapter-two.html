                        <h2>The Process of Self-Publishing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Self-publishing changed how writers share their work. Before platforms like Amazon's KDP and
                            IngramSpark,
                            getting published meant finding a traditional publisher and waiting for approval. Now,
                            anyone with a
                            finished manuscript and a bit of patience can release a book to readers around the world.
                            Both KDP
                            and
                            IngramSpark make that possible, but they work in slightly different ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Publishing through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) is simple. Once you've created
                            your
                            manuscript
                            and cover, fill in the book's details, choose your publishing rights, and set your price.
                            KDP lets
                            you
                            promote your book through Kindle Unlimited, Amazon ads, and your author page. You can also
                            add A+
                            Content,
                            which includes visuals, short text sections, and comparison charts that make your book page
                            stand
                            out.
                            Expanded Distribution makes your book available to libraries and other retailers, though KDP
                            still
                            focuses
                            mainly on Amazon and Kindle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IngramSpark gives you wider distribution but takes a little more work to set up. You'll need
                            an ISBN
                            and
                            a
                            properly formatted EPUB file before you upload. Once the book passes validation and pricing
                            approval, it
                            becomes available through Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple Books, Kobo, OverDrive, and many
                            other
                            partners.
                            It
                            takes more effort than KDP, but the trade-off is more potential readers, especially outside
                            Amazon's
                            ecosystem.

                        <h2>Editing and Quality Control</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is where a lot of self-published books fall apart. Without an editor, it's easy to miss
                            things:
                            typos, weird spacing, broken links, or formatting that looks fine on one screen but awful on
                            another.
                            Amazon removes any e-books that don't meet their standard of quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To keep your e-book looking professional, you don't need to follow a long publishing guide.
                            Just
                            focus
                            on
                            the basics: make sure the formatting is clean (EPUB or MOBI formats work best), the cover
                            looks
                            good, the
                            table
                            of contents works, and your links and metadata are correct.
                            The book doesn't have to be perfect, but it should look finished. Readers notice when a book
                            feels
                            rushed,
                            and
                            so do retailers. Once your book reaches platforms like Amazon, presentation and polish start
                            to
                            matter
                            just as much as the story itself.

                    <section id="payment-options">
                        <h2>Royalties and Payment</h2>
                        <p>
                            Amazon gives you two options for royalties: 35% or 70%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 70% option pays more but comes with rules:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="royalties">
                            <li>Your price must be between $2.99 and $9.99</li>
                            <li>Your book can't be public domain</li>
                            <li>This option only applies in certain regions</li>
                            <li>Amazon subtracts a small delivery cost based on file size</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The 35% option is simpler and tends to be more flexible:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="royalties">
                            <li>Works for any price range between $0.99 and $200</li>
                            <li>No delivery fees, even for large files</li>
                            <li>Better for books with lots of images or heavy formatting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If your book is mostly text and fits the listing price range, the 70% plan is the better
                            deal. If
                            it's
                            image-heavy or priced outside that range, the 35% plan makes more sense.

                    <section id="writing-descriptions">
                        <h2>Writing a Book Description with HTML</h2>
                        <p>When you publish through KDP, you can write your book's "blurb" directly into a text box. You
                            can
                            also use
                            basic HTML tags to customize the description to your liking, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="book-description">
                            <li>br for line breaks</li>
                            <li>b for bold text</li>
                            <li>i for italics</li>
                            <li>p for paragraphs</li>
                            <li>ul for bullet points</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Keep in mind that a good book description should be quick to read, easy to follow, and hard
                            to
                            forget.
                            It needs to stand out to readers and make them want to click "Buy". Once a book is
                            ready
                            to publish, there is really only one place most writers look to first.
