                            E-books didn't just change how people read - they changed <i>who</i> gets to read. Digital
                            books
                            have opened doors for readers with vision, mobility, or learning disabilities. Adjustable
                            fonts,
                            screen readers, and text-to-speech features make it possible for more people to enjoy books
                            in ways
                            that work best for them. The next challenge belongs to the people who create and
                            distribute e-books. Accessibility features only matter when publishers and authors know how
                            to use
                            them.

                            Accessibility in e-books continue to improve, but publishing standards are still not where
                            they
                            should be.
                            For instance, many college textbooks remain inaccessible to students with disabilities.
                            Dyslexic
                            readers often need to adjust fonts or background colors, while visually impaired students
                            depend on
                            tools like text-to-speech, font scaling, or zoom. Publishers are still overlooking these
                            differences
                            when designing digital materials.

                            An <a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.358">evaluation in 2017</a>
                            revealed how
                            limited accessibility was across most e-books<sup>3</sup>. Four years later, a <a
                                href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.557">2021 study</a> found that
                            some
                            progress
                            had been made, but most e-books and e-textbooks still failed to meet even the most
                            basic accessibility standards<sup>4</sup>. Each textbook was reviewed using sixteen
                            accessibility
                            categories
                            from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), created by the World Wide Web
                            Consortium
                            (W3C). The most common problems included missing alt text for images, poor color contrast,
                            disorganized headings, and code that screen readers couldn't interpret properly.

                        <p>
                            The problem comes down to a lack of understanding. Many publishers and platforms still fail
                            to build
                            accessibility features into their content from the start. Real progress depends on
                            awareness,
                            education, and stronger standards being applied before textbooks ever reach students.
                            E-books have
                            made reading more inclusive, but accessibility still has a long way to go. The progress
                            made so far shows that technology can open doors, but the next challenge is keeping those
                            doors
                            open for everyone. What happens next will decide not only how we read, but how publishing
                            continues to evolve in a digital world.
